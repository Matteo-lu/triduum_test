# Interface to search on wikipedia

This is a test requested by the company Triduum for the development of an interface that consumes the Wikipedia API to perform searches according to a keyword.

Interface made through version v2.6.14 of the Vue js framework using simple HTML and CSS files.

## How to Run

To run it make sure of the following.

* Clone this repository
* Run the index.html file through a live server of your choice.
* Make sure you have Vue js version v2.6.14 installed.

Once the file opened you should see the unique interface with a search bar.

If you click on the Submit button without entering a keyword, you will see the following message:

```
Please enter a keyword to search
```

Enter a keyword and press the submit button, you will get a list with each element with the following format:

```
pageid - title
Snippet
```
For additional information on the response format of the Wikipedia API refer to this [link](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search/es#JavaScript).
